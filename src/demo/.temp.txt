PUBLICATIONS
  A Study on Relation between Mathematics and Music                              Cambridge Publishing
  This report is mainly based on how different mathematical aspects are being used in musical theory and
  how music has helped in the development of mathematics. How the musicians developed mathematical
  concepts and vice versa. Historical relations between math and music and enhancement of math from
  music has been described. Various concepts of math, like Fibonacci series, Harmonics and Logarithmic
  series etc., are used in music, but this report focuses mainly on Harmonics.
