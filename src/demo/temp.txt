can lead to database down.
A monitoring script to check whether all keys are able to connect to the database (HANA) or not. If all the
keys are not working, that means there are some network connectivity issue or database  hung situation or
memory issues or locked condition due to incorrect login attempts. All those incidents can lead to database
down situation.
A script to set any key in HANA database. It first set the user on which key is set by one predefined
password. Then it will set the key by same password. After that the key will be able to connect to the
Script to resolve Security compliances in HANA Database.
Technology used: HANA and Sybase database, Bash, SQL.
Summer Training (2013 June-July):
(Ardent Computech Pvt Ltd)
Online Product Store (eCommerce Application)
Developed an online product store having the following functionalities:
Filtering  functionality  using  which  all  the  products  can  be  filtered  on  the  basis  of  category,  price  and
popularity.  Sorted  view  of  products  based  on  the  price  and  the  user  ratings.  Product  availability  check.
Adding to cart and wishlisting.
Technologies used: J2EE(following MVC structure), Oracle 10g Database , Tomcat 7.
Online Music Repository System(using Django framework):
(2014 June -July)
Developed a web based app that lets users to upload and store their favorite songs.
It also facilitates the users to download self-uploaded and other songs uploaded by different users depending on
their permission setting.
Page 2 of 3
Implemented a feature where songs can be stored in the server directly from the third party websites by providing
the downloadable links.
Implemented a rigorous search functionality that finds out all the relevant albums and songs in response to user
Technologies used : Django framework, Python.
Final Year Project (2014-2015):
Online Logical Error detector(A Human Computer Interaction Application) :
Developed  an  online  coding  platform  for  the  naive  programmers  to  check  out  for  logical  errors  in  a  C
it has a predefined set of programs and their implementation logics stored in the database in terms of an
intermediate  string  with  special  syntax.  It  extracts  the  logic  out  of  the  code  submitted  by  the  user  and
compares  with  the  logic  stored  in  the  database.  If  the  special  searching  mechanism  of  the  matching
algorithm  detects  a  mismatch,  it  tracks  down  the  erroneous  statement  in  the  program  and  displays  it  in
a  user  friendly  way.  It  only  accepts  compiled  (syntactically  correct)  programs  as  input  because  the
concept of logical error applies only when the program executes successfully.
Tools and Technology: J2EE(maintaining MVC structure),Oracle 10g,Tomcat7,Eclipse(Indigo)
